## What is Dataship?

[Dataship](https://dataship.io/) is a way to share data and analysis,
from simple charts to complex machine learning, with anyone in the
world easily and for free. It allows you to create notebooks that hold
and deliver your data, as well as text, images and inline scripts for
doing analysis and visualization. The people you share it with can
read, execute and even edit a copy of your notebook and publish the
remixed version as a fork.

## What are the challenges you face working with data?

It’s hard to share it with others. Tools like Jupyter (iPython
notebook)[^jupyter] make it much easier and more affordable to do
analysis (with the help of open source projects like numpy[^numpy] and
pandas[^pandas]). What they don’t do is allow you to *cheaply and
easily share that with the world*. **If it were as easy to share data
and analysis as it is to share pictures of your breakfast, the world
would be a more enlightened place.** Dataship is helping to build that
world.

## How are you working with the specs?

Every notebook on Dataship is also a Data Package[^datapackage]. Like
other Data Packages it can be downloaded, along with its data, just by
giving its URL to a tool like dpm[^dpm]. Additionally, working with
existing Data Packages is easy. Just as you can fork other notebooks,
you can also fork existing Data Packages, even when they’re located
somewhere else, like GitHub.

*Dataship in action*

Every cell in a notebook is represented by a resource entry[^resource]
in an underlying Data Package. This also allows for interesting
possibilities. One of these is executable Data Packages. Since the
code is included inline and its dependencies are explicit and bounded,
a very simple tool could be written to execute a Data Package-based
notebook from the command line, printing the results to the console
and writing images to the current directory.

## What else would you like to see developed?

A JavaScript version of some of the functionality in Good
Tables[^goodtables] would be most useful to me right now, specifically
header detection in parsed csv contents (output of PapaParse). I’d
also like the option in dpm to not put things in a ‘datapackages’
folder. That turns out to almost never be what I want when downloading
a dataset.

## What are the next things you are going to be working on yourself?

My next task will be building and integrating the machine learning and
neural network components into Dataship. After that I’ll be focusing
on features that allow organizations to store private encrypted data,
in addition to the default public storage. The focus of the platform
will always be open data, but hosting closed data sources will allow
us to nudge people towards sharing, when it makes sense.

## What do you think are some other potential use cases?

The volume of personal data is growing exponentially: medical data,
internet activity, media consumption. These are just a few existing
examples. The rise of the Internet of Things will only accelerate
this. People are also beginning to see the value in controlling their
data themselves. Providing mechanisms for doing this will likely
become important over the next ten years.
